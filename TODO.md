# TODO
### Issues
- The API is being continuously called every 10 seconds, for some reason. I believe it has to pertain with how useEffect is being called. 
### Features
##### Set up an .env to be read by both front end and back end
- Useful when determining what port the application is being run on.
### Chores
- Refactor duplicate code in Flask routes. Consider also setting up the target variables as a dictionary
### Considerations
- Show the user how many courses and/or entries per course are in the to-be-generated excel document
