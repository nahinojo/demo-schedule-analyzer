## Issues

## Features

### Dockerize
- Poetry
    - How to execute main.py from the terminal?
    - How to build the poetry env?


### CICD
- Docker

### Refresh Database
Automatically refresh the database when changes are made to the calendar.

## Chores

Consider breaking up the workflows into smaller sequential jobs, however that works.

## Considerations
